### in start training wer done using logitech cam , but in this camera images wer unale to crop, due to buit-in procesors of the camera, and so shifted with raspberry pi cam, and was even more easy to set up configrations ))

### thought of using another car with all easy setup to collect data , and actually this model worked even better for me <3 and was awesome ;)
